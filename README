A tool for recording and logging audio, video, television broadcasts, and more.

==== Audio recorder ====

Development roadmap:

- Most important:

  Linux/ALSA
  Linux/PulseAudio
  Windows/DirectSound  (Windows 95 OSR2 to 98 to ME, 2000 to XP to 7 to 10)
  MacOSX/CoreAudio     (Mac OS X High Sierra and Mojave)

- Less important:

  Linux/OSS
  Windows/WinMM        (Windows 95, NT 4.0 and higher)
  Windows/DirectSound  (Windows 95, NT 4.0 and higher)
  Windows/CoreAudio    (Windows Vista to 7 to 8 to 10)
  MacOSX/CoreAudio     (Mac OS X Sierra, El Capitan)

- Even less important:

  MacOSX/CoreAudio     (Mac OS X 10.4.x on an old PowerPC based Mac Mini 32-bit)
  Windows/WinMM        (Windows 3.1 Win32s 32-bit)
  Windows/WinMM        (Windows 3.0 to 3.1 16-bit, Windows 95/NT and higher 16-bit)
  MS-DOS/SoundBlaster  (MS-DOS 32-bit, with Sound Blaster 2.0/Pro/16 support)
  MS-DOS/SoundBlaster  (MS-DOS 32-bit, with ESS688/ESS1688 support)
  MS-DOS/SoundBlaster  (MS-DOS 32-bit, with SC-400 support)
  MS-DOS/SoundBlaster  (MS-DOS 16-bit, with Sound Blaster 2.0/Pro/16 support)
  MS-DOS/SoundBlaster  (MS-DOS 16-bit, with ESS688/ESS1688 support)
  MS-DOS/SoundBlaster  (MS-DOS 16-bit, with SC-400 support)
  MS-DOS/GUS           (MS-DOS 32-bit, with Gravis Ultrasound)
  MS-DOS/GUS           (MS-DOS 16-bit, with Gravis Ultrasound)

==== Future tools ====

- Video4linux audio/video capture (adaptations to video-capture-v1-public project)

  - Permanent Record mode enable
  - Record to AVI file in PERMREC directory structure if enabled
  - Auto-cut AVI capture on the hour every hour if enabled

- Screen capture with audio

  - Video capture of the whole screen
  - Video capture of a region of the screen
  - Video capture of a region of the screen following a specific window
  - Video capture of a specific window (i.e. compositor-based desktops, read the window surface)
  - With audio device (same audio devices available in audio recorder)

- Internet radio recorder

  - Shoutcast MP3, AAC, Ogg Vorbis (and Opus?) recorder (reading from M3U link)
  - Auto-segmentation of audio stream, using knowledge of the codec/format to
    cut cleanly on codec frame boundary
  - Ask for Shoutcast metadata, and retrieve from the stream
  - Record Shoutcast metadata in TXT file alongside recording, with file offsets where event occured

  Less important:

  - WinAMP TV NSV streams (do they still exist??)

- Internet live stream (HLS) recorder

  - Obtain the M3U8 file (HLS stream)
  - Determine all streams
  - Download HLS fragments to recording directory
  - Have code re-download HLS fragments that didn't download the first time around.
    This is a gripe of mine with FFMPEG where it tries once and gives up too easily.
  - If the fragments are MPEG transport streams, assemble completed fragments into an M2TS
    file (auto-cut at the top of the hour).
  - If fragments missed (no longer available), then move the incomplete or missing fragment
    into another MISSED subdirectory and start a new M2TS file.
  - If the fragments are part of an MP4 file, ...? (less common, fortunately)
  - In this way modern live streams can be reliably recorded as-is without transcoding,
    screen capture loss, or FFMPEG remuxing the transport stream in any way.

- DVB/ATSC tuner recorder

  - DVB Linux API support
  - C++ code to read /etc/channels.conf (used by DVB tools)
  - Channel selection on startup (to tune to)
  - Tuner/frontend to use, selection
  - Setup tuner on startup
  - Ask tuner for raw MPEG transport stream, and record it to a .TS or .M2TS file
  - Auto-cut at the top of the hour
  - UI show error status (number of TS packets with errors, etc)
  - Possible tool to tune and generate/update /etc/channels.conf in a faster
    more efficient manner than the stock DVB tools.
